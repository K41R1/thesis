\chapter{Proposed Solution}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter is devoted to present our proposed solution to index data and make an \textbf{EDA} as well as 
implementing the solution in a distributed way.

\section{Architecture of the solution}
\subsection{Distributed Architecture}
\subsubsection{Definition}
A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.\\ 
The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal.
 
\subsubsection{Benefits}
Using a distributed architecture can make our life much easier, because it provides: \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scaling}: Distributed Systems are easily scalable.
    \item \textbf{Prallelism}: Distributed Systems are designed for parallelism.
    \item \textbf{Reliability}: Distributed Systems can tolerate hardware failures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical architecture}
In this section we present, the logical architecture of our framework to index investment data provided by MAJESTEYE.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Zookeeper Ensemble}: 3 Zookeeper instances to synchronize \textit{Solr} nodes.
    \item \textbf{Apache Solr}: 5 Solr nodes used to index data.
    \item \textbf{Hadoop (HDFS)}: 1 NameNode and 2 DataNode used to store index and provide easy scaling.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Docker (Physical Architecture)}
all instances are running under \textbf{Docker Engine} to simulate a Mini-Cloud Environnement.
\subsubsection{Definition}
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
\subsubsection{Docker Conatiner}
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. \\A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

    \caption[Docker Architecture Overview]{Simple Docker Environnement}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Benefits}
Docker Containers are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standard}: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere.
    \item \textbf{Lightweight}: Containers share the machineâ€™s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application.
    \item \textbf{Secure}:  Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Environnement}
\subsection{Apache Zookeeper}

\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{4cm}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{images/zookeeper.jpeg}
\end{wrapfigure}
\textbf{ZooKeeper} is a coordination service for distributed Systems. \textbf{SolrCloud} uses ZooKeeper for three 
critical operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Centralized configuration and storage.
    \item Detection and notification when the cluster state changes.
    \item Shard-Leader election. 
\end{itemize}  
\textbf{ZooKeeper} is also a distributed system that can be deployed to be fault tolerant and highly
scalable. For production, we set up a separate ZooKeeper ensemble made up of at
least three nodes, 3 as ZooKeeper relies on a majority of nodes agreeing on the state of a znode at all times.

\textbf{Apache Solr} as our indexing \& searching framework. we'll install and configure \textbf{Solr} on it's distributed version a.k.a \textbf{SolrCloud}

\subsection{Apache Hadoop (HDFS)}
The Hadoop Distributed File System (\textbf{HDFS}) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It has many similarities with existing distributed file systems. However, the differences from other distributed file systems are significant. \textbf{HDFS} is highly fault-tolerant and is designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware. \\
\textbf{Solr} has support for writing and reading its index and transaction log files to the HDFS distributed filesystem.
